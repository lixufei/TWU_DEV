1.Gini Coefficient
 The Gini Coefficient in China between 2004 and 2014 is as following:
 2004:0.473
 2005:0.485
 2006:0.487
 2007:0.484
 2008:0.491
 2009:0.49
 2010:0.481
 2011:0.477
 2012:0.474
 2013:0.473
 2014:0.469
 we can got that the data is lower a little in closer years.
 According to a statistic ,we can see the 8 countries with the greatest income distribution equality between 2003 and 2012 based on the Gini index.
 Sweden:0.25
 Ukraine:0.256
 Norway:0.258
 Slovakia:0.26
 Belarus:0.265
 Finland:0.269
 Romania:0.274
 Afghanistan:0.278
 Maybe Sweden has a more fair income distribution.
 
2.Learning About Imperialism
India was ever ruled by British and there were two sides:Churchill,who was loyal to the Empire and thought about reaching an accommodation with the 
Congress Party,and Bose,who tried his best to liberate and got help from German through his own effort.Obviously,Bose was the right side Indian should
be on.Wars led to countless deaths and famine.Where there is oppression, there is resistance.India is a country with long history,and what they did has 
proved all.
