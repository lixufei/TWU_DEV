	I entered thougtworks through Campus Recruiting.The process is the same as others like me.
The first time I went into the office,Oh,so many handsome boys and beautiful girls.The day I 
signed Tripartite agreement,I knowed that TW treat us so fairly no matter where we come from 
and no mather what school we graduate from.Even when TW let us choose the laptop we will use,
I realized that I'm so lucky to be a member of TW.
