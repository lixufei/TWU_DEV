《I hava a dream》Martin Luther King, Jr.

	This speech is about racial discrimination.White and Black people are treated unfairly,and Black people
decide fight for their rights through the activity.In TW,I know that there are not classes between colleagues.
Everyone manage himself and have right to comment freely.I believe that we all improve our abilities rapidly 
in the environment like this.
