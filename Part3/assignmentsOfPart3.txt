1.Assignment: Fighting oppression
While this was in the US, there are similar acts of discrimination in every country across the world. TW wants to make sure that it is a welcome place for men and women, so we need to keep an eye out for the discrimination that is a "normal" part of each country where we operate.

Find the percentage of women who get Computer Science degrees in the country where you live. Include a link to where you got your information.
What groups in your country are oppressed? Are there groups of people who, for historical reasons, are treated badly? Denied education? Denied rights? Or just treated badly?
Please upload your response in a text file below.
